restify-socketio-boilerplate
============================

This is a boilerplate project for building REST-APIs with WebSockets using the Restify and Socket.io Node packages

The intent is to have a very simple web presense because this service is more important to machines.

* The REST API allows machines to send information (publisher)
* The WebSocket allows clients to listen to information changes (subscriber)
